# London_bikes_DA_visualization
On this project, I built a end-to-end data analytics project using Python and Tableau

The dataset that I used here downloaded from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hmavrodiev/london-bike-sharing-dataset
Or directly you can upload the dataset to your Jupyter workplace by using Kaggle API (instructions given in 'London_bikes.ipynb' file)
1. Project Introduction:
Overview of the dataset used (e.g., sales, customer behavior, etc.).
Explanation of the objectives, such as generating insights, creating dashboards, or solving a business problem.

2. Data Preparation:
Using Python (and libraries like pandas) to clean, process, and analyze the raw data.
Handling missing values, transforming variables, and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA).

3. Data Visualization:
Exporting processed data to Tableau for creating interactive dashboard.
Building charts like bar plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps to communicate findings.

4. End-to-End Workflow:
Combining Python for data manipulation and Tableau for visualization in a seamless pipeline.
Presenting a polished portfolio project that showcases technical and analytical skills.

The interactive dashboard created:
